            <p>With recreation, entertainment, and social functions being some of the main selling points of leisure buildings, it is no doubt that these types of structures are focused heavily on aesthetics. Aside from the mathematical concepts applied to ensuring safety within and around the building, different mathematical concepts were also applied to make it look the way it is.</p>

                <h2>Golden Ratio for leisure structures</h2>
                <p>
                    Applying the golden ratio to leisure structures can offer several benefits in terms of aesthetics, proportions, and visual harmony. The golden ratio, often represented by the mathematical value of approximately 1.618, has been revered for centuries for its pleasing and balanced aesthetic qualities. That being said, a well-designed leisure structure that incorporates the golden ratio principles can provide a visually pleasing environment, which may contribute to a positive user experience and a sense of well-being. Aesthetically pleasing spaces can create a calming and enjoyable atmosphere, potentially reducing stress and enhancing the overall satisfaction of visitors. This, in turn, can indirectly contribute to a safer and more inclusive environment by promoting a positive state of mind and reducing potential distractions.

                <h2>Sin-like structures in parks</h2>
                <p>Sin waves are patterns that are commonly occuring in nature. It can be found in wind, sound, and light. In TheCITY, sin waves are utilized for leisure structures such as parks to mitigate potential hazards that a public space could bring. Aesthetically, these waves (when used as a basis for installations) can promote positivity as it could generate a sense of movement, fluidity, and harmony with the surrounding natural environment. It could also promote clear sightliness when these installations are large. By avoiding straight and obstructed views, visitors can have better visibility of their surroundings. This enhanced visibility promotes safety by allowing people to anticipate and react to potential risks. Sin-like structures, such as gentle mounds or landscape features, can serve as natural barriers or boundaries within the park. They can help deter visitors from venturing into restricted or unsafe areas, such as steep slopes, bodies of water, or potentially hazardous environments. By intuitively discouraging access to such areas, these structures contribute to visitor safety. Lastly,  Sin-like structures can be designed with accessibility in mind, incorporating gentle slopes and curves that are easier for individuals with mobility challenges to navigate. By avoiding sharp angles or sudden changes in elevation, these structures promote inclusive design and ensure that everyone, including individuals with disabilities, can access and enjoy the park safely.</p>
