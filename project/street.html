            <p>Streets are home to countless misfortunes of others and it can be terrifying. With different mathematical concepts these tragic events can be minimized. Alongside this, mathematics can also be used in designing and shaping the traffic with the ultimate goal of making the experience in the streets safe and sound for everyone. </p>

                    Commuting is for everyone! We have to travel from point A to point B everyday in order to provide for our needs and enjoy the lives we have. It may be a walk in the park for most of us but that doesn't mean we can say the same for those with disabilities. In TheCITY, everyone will be able to navigate the streets with the help of Graph Theory in modeling transportation networks. Those with visual impairment will be able to identify the most accessible routes. By considering factors such as the presence of tactile paving, audible traffic signals, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, graph-based algorithms can calculate optimized routes that prioritize accessibility. This ensures that blind commuters can navigate the city efficiently and safely. This algorithm can be integrated into an Augmented Reality device/application that has interactive spots all around the city. Combined with real-time data, the AR Application can enable dynamic navigation assistance for blind individuals. By incorporating information on road closures, public transportation delays, and other relevant factors into the graph model, navigation systems can provide up-to-date instructions to blind commuters, guiding them through the most efficient and accessible paths. With this, TheCITY can create more accessible and inclusive methods of transportation. This not only empowers blind individuals to navigate the city independently but also fosters their social participation, increases their mobility, and enhances their overall quality of life.

                <h2>Biomimicry for Safer Streets</h2>
                <p>Biomimicry makes it possible to duplicate an environment in its entirety, a process, or a form. Designers can produce systems and products that perform similarly to those found in the natural world by taking inspiration from it. Making cities and other man-made structures in tune with nature is the aim. </p>
                <p><br>We can use ants as an example of how to optimize traffic flow in the context of roadways. Ants are well recognized for their ability to maneuver across their colonies quickly and avoid traffic. For the purpose of creating algorithms that improve traffic flow, researchers have investigated ant trail networks. Traffic management systems can be created to dynamically allocate resources and lessen traffic congestion by modeling the decentralized decision-making and adaptive behavior of ants.</p>
                <p><br>The materials used in signage are another illustration of how roadways may be made safer and more environmentally friendly. As we can see in nature, trees swing in different directions to avoid being damaged by the powerful wind. Similar reasoning can be made about the ubiquitous roadway signs that we see. By doing this, street signs are less likely to break and more resistant to heavy gusts. </p>
                <p><br>Of course, math is applied in biomimicry as well. Analyzing the patterns in nature is one use of mathematics. For instance, fractals are mathematical patterns found in nature, including branching trees, coastlines, and cloud formations. The mathematical principles of self-similarity and recursion can be used by scientists and engineers to analyze and reproduce these patterns in manufactured systems.</p>
