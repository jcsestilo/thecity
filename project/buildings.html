            <p>With human settlements, work, and other general purpose activities being some usage of buildings, it is no doubt that safety within the building and around the area around it should be ensured. The application of different mathematical concepts helps with preventing any safety concerns when it comes to buildings. Also, this makes anyone’s experience free from worries as they step their foot into the building. </p>

                    Deaf-inclusive architecture
                    As time goes on, our architecture has been more and more inclusive for our citizens. It is known to cater people with disorders so that they will have an easier method to do their way of life. An example of this is the ramp we see beside stairs on buildings. Ramps provide a way for people using wheelchairs to go inside a building with ease without the difficulty of going through the stairs. 
                    <br><br>
                    Certainly, architecture for the deaf is no exception. Structures made to cater deaf people are becoming more and more common in this era. More designs are being implemented every day to have an inclusive environment for everyone. <a href="http://deafspace.weebly.com/a-brief-history.html#:~:text=Ronald%20Mace%2C%20an%20architect%20working,About%20UD%2C%22%202008">DeafSpace</a> is a type of architecture that aims to provide an inclusive environment for deaf people. It started with Ronald Mace, who is an architect in North Carolina University. Mace defined DeafSpace as “the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design”
                    <br><br>
                    Since deaf people have heightened sensitivity to other senses such as vision and touch, it is noted that it is designed to provide a space for people to provide eye contact with each other. Some examples of DeafSpace architecture are the following:<br><br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eddies - In Eddies design, a separate space is provided along hallways or pathways for people to converse with each other while walking. In this design, people are given the appropriate space to converse with each other, maintaining eye contact and giving people the chance to pause for socialization.</li>
                    <li>Vibration Zones - Deaf people often get startled when people approach them from behind. Considering this, vibration zones provide a way for the deaf people to have an auditory clue whenever a person is entering a room or approaching them. An example of a vibration zone would be having the entrance of a room directly beside an area for work or table. This way, the person using the table would not be startled by the person behind them because their field of vision includes the entrance of the door.</li>
                    <li>Wider Circulation Spaces - Deaf people would normally converse while walking. Their focus would be on the person they are signing to rather than the path they are taking. A problem that occurs here is that a group would stand side-by-side in order to see each other, there may be people moving towards the opposite direction and may cause accidental injuries if the space is cramped. A solution is by giving each side of the path enough space to accommodate groups and by having a different material for each side of the road which acts as a tactile cue that they may be counterflowing. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                    In conclusion, there are a lot of designs and structures made to cater to people with disorders, particularly deaf people. However, with the technology being more and more advanced as time goes on, it is sure that more architectures will be invented and implemented to provide a much easier life for people with disabilities.

                <h2>Humane Layout for Penitentiaries</h2>
                <p>Human prison design aims to create more human and rehabilitative prison environments. Consolidated or stacked buildings typical of prisons may increase tension and limit inmates' freedom of movement. Humane prisons, in comparison, have a campus-style arrangement with distinct buildings for accommodation, education, and visitor access. This layout makes it simple to reach outside areas and the natural world and fosters a sense of normalcy. Natural light is made possible by the use of materials like glass, cork, and wood, which also decreases noise and improves the aesthetics of the environment.  Through the use of communal areas and smaller groups, the design also emphasizes improving interactions between correctional personnel and convicts. According to studies, this method of direct contact strengthens the bonds between staff and inmates and lowers the number of violent occurrences. Due to their smaller jail populations, Western Europe and Scandinavia have a higher prevalence of humane prison design.</p>
                <p><br>By contributing to numerous areas of the design and planning process, mathematics can aid in the creation of humane prisons. The design of the prisons' physical environment serves as an illustration of this. To promote a safe and uplifting environment for both the guards and the prisoners, measurements of the sizes of the recreation spaces, rooms, and other venues for various activities are used.</p>
