            <p>Skyscrapers stand tall averaging in 40-50 stories. This number can go up to over 100 in some cases. But behind this magnificent creation that keeps reducing the gap between heaven and earth comes different architectural design principles, engineering expertise, and mathematical calculations to ensure the safety of those who will lay their feet on the building.</p>

                <h2>Fractal-like Honeycomb patterns for non-structural walls</h2>
                <p>One important factor in high-rise buildings is the load imposed on it. This is the inspiration for applying honeycomb patterns as a substitute for traditional walls. Specifically, walls that are non-structural. The naturally occuring honeycomb pattern is admired for its high strength and lower weight. The latter fits the bill as non-structural walls are often designed to be lightweight, and honeycomb patterns align well with this requirement. The repeated hexagonal cells reduce material usage while maintaining structural integrity. This leads to lighter walls, making them easier to handle, transport, and install. Since the cells of honeycomb structures are hollow, the efficient use of materials and the potential for energy savings contribute to the overall environmental sustainability of honeycomb-patterned walls. By reducing the use of resources and minimizing energy consumption, these walls can align with green building principles and help create more environmentally friendly spaces.

                <h2>Shear strength improvements using Geometry </h2>
                <p>One thing that fascinates everyone who would see a skyscraper is its height. This characteristic of skyscrapers is what separates them from normal buildings. But, this very same characteristic generates one of its biggest problems, it introduces swaying. This is caused by a wind induced phenomenon called vortex shedding. To counter this, architects employ various strategies. Tapering is a design trick that makes the skyscraper skinnier as it gets taller. Softening is another design trick that softens the edge of the building. This makes the building appear rounded and this is because buildings with hard edges suffer from the effects on wind. Another design trick is having an opening in the skyscraper. This design trick lets the wind pass through an opening where it is blowing the strongest. Twisting is another design trick that twists the shape of a skyscraper. This redirects the wind upward, solving the issue of swaying. Damping is the last design trick architects use to counter swaying. This can be done by using a damper in the form of slosh tank or tuned mass dampers.</p>
                <p>In this scenario math is used in a lot of different ways. One obvious usage of math is how geometry is used in designing the look of the skyscraper. Most importantly, math is used for calculations on forces, stresses, and other dynamic forces like winds and earthquakes to ensure the integrity and the safety of those who are in the building.</p>
